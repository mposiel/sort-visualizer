# Sort Visualizer using Tkinter
## Project Description
The sort visualizer project is a simple yet powerful tool to visualize how different sorting algorithms work. It uses the Tkinter module to create a graphical user interface that allows users to interact with the program and see the sorting process in real-time.

The program currently supports four different sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and selection sort. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate function, making it easy to add more sorting algorithms in the future.

The program also allows users to adjust the speed of the visualization and size of array using sliders, making it easy to see the sorting process at different speeds and data sets.

# Future Improvements
There are several improvements that can be made to this project in the future, including:

Adding more sorting algorithms: Although the project already includes four popular sorting algorithms, there are many more sorting algorithms that can be added to the program.

Improving the user interface: While the current user interface is functional, there is room for improvement. For example, adding more customization options, such as changing the color scheme, bar sizes, etc., could make the program more visually appealing.

# Conclusion
The sort visualizer project is a useful tool for anyone interested in learning how different sorting algorithms work. With further improvements, it could become an even more powerful tool for education.
